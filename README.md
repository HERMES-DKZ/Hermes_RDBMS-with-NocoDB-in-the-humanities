# Relational Databases with NocoDB in the humanities

Welcome to the Carpentry for relational databases with NocoDB in the humanities! This course is designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of relational databases through practical, hands-on experience with NocoDB, an open-source platform that transforms your database into a smart spreadsheet. With this you can use a databse, without coding experience and confusing files. Although the course is primarily aimed at humanities scholars, the principles are easily transferable to other subjects, which means that the course can also be relevant and interesting for other disciplines.
